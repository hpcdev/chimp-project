This directory contains examples of building code external to the chimp project.
Included are examples of building the exact same code using the following build
systems:
      system         directory          NOTES
    -----------     -----------         -----------
    Boost.Build        BJam             Imports chimp into project using
                                        'use-project' rule.  All other
                                        dependencies (linking and include
                                        directories) are automatically provided.  

    Kitware CMake      CMake-external   Using an installed version of chimp and
                                        associated libraries.  This only
                                        provides link-dependency tracking in the
                                        application code and not between chimp
                                        (and others) and application code. 

    Kitware CMake      CMake-internal   Using chimp and associated libraries as
                                        sub-projects, such that you use
                                        'add_subdirectory' to add chimp (and
                                        others) into your project.
                                        This build-type provides cross library
                                        link-dependency tracking.
                                        THIS EXAMPLE IS NOT YET FINISHED!

    Traditional        Make             Makefile must explicitly specify all
                                        linking dependencies and include
                                        directories.  

The code compiled by each of these examples is a copy of the
chimp/examples/RuntimeDB example code, placed external to the chimp package just
to demonstrate different ways that one might build.
