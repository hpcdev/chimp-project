Installation Instructions
*************************

If you use Boost.Build/bjam:
    1.  execute the project-shell script
    2.  Build your stuff like normal
        (see examples/build-examples/BJam for a sample Boost.Build project)
    3.  Have fun


  NOTES--The project-shell script does the following:
    1.  Makes sure that Boost.Build is configured
    2.  Builds bjam
    3.  Puts bjam into your search path
    4.  Sets up your environment so bjam can find the Boost.Build files
    5.  Starts up a new instance of your own login shell
        If you happen to use bash it also:
            a.  Changes your command prompt to show you the current git branch
                and its status
            b.  Creates the gstat command that will show the status of the
                currently checked out branch as well as the currently checkout
                branches of ALL submodules.


If you want to use something else and perform a typical build/install process:
    1.  execute the install.sh script
        This script performs all of its operations in a project-shell (ensuring
        Boost.Build availability).

        Note that there are several options for install.sh
        Use './install.sh --help' to show these options (such as location of
        build directory, location of install directory, build variant, toolset,
        etc.)
    2.  Include the header directories and add the appropriate link commands to
        satisfy any dependencies for CHIMP and its direct dependencies.  
        (see the examples/build-examples directory for usage help--assuming that
        the installtion has already taken place.)
