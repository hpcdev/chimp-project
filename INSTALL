Installation Instructions
*************************
PREREQUISITES:
    1.  Download Boost from http://www.boost.org
        Currently 1.40.0 and 1.41.0 are known to work for CHIMP.  Some earlier
        and later versions may work also.  Portability issues for non-standard
        systems, such as often found in large HPC environments, seem to still
        vary from Boost version to Boost version.  
    2.  Extract the Boost archive and rename it such that it resides in this
        directory with the name of 'boost'.  Alternatively, a softlink to the
        boost directory can be made.  In other words, 'chimp-project/boost'
        should contain the boost distribution.

        In the future, it should become possible to use a previously installed
        copy of boost.


The next steps depend on whether you will use Boost.Build/bjam or whether you
want things installed in the traditional sense:

IF YOU USE Boost.Build/bjam:
    1.  execute the project-shell script
    2.  Build your stuff like normal
        (see examples/build-examples/BJam for a sample Boost.Build project)


IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO USE Boost.Build/bjam but rather perform a typical
    build/install process:
    1.  execute the install.sh script
        This script performs all of its operations in a project-shell (ensuring
        Boost.Build availability).

        Note that there are several options for install.sh
        Use './install.sh --help' to show these options (such as location of
        build directory, location of install directory, build variant, toolset,
        etc.)
    2.  Include the header directories and add the appropriate link commands to
        satisfy any dependencies for CHIMP and its direct dependencies.  
        (see the examples/build-examples directory for usage help--assuming that
        the installtion has already taken place.)




NOTES--The project-shell script does the following:
  1.  Makes sure that Boost.Build is configured
  2.  Builds bjam
  3.  Puts bjam into your search path
  4.  Sets up your environment so bjam can find the Boost.Build files
  5.  Starts up a new instance of your own login shell
      If you happen to use bash it also:
          a.  Changes your command prompt to show you the current git branch
              and its status
          b.  Creates the gstat command that will show the status of the
              currently checked out branch as well as the currently checkout
              branches of ALL submodules.
